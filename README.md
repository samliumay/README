## Projects
### DSAA 
Basically I wrote mostly used algorithms and data structures. I will be giving the video lessons at the superpeer(In Turkish and English). But the codes and basic explanation will be avaiable on github. Also I will be explaining how to use at github either. So you can go at check it out. I recomend you to go with this order:
- DSAA-Complexity
- DSAA-LinkedList 
- DSAA-DoubleLinkedList 
- DSAA-Stack
- DSAA-Queue 
- DSAA-Trees
- DSAA-HashTables 
- DSAA-Graphs
- DSAA-Heaps
- DSAA-Recursion 
- DSAA-RecursionBasedBinarySearchTrees 
- DSAA-TreeTraversal
- DSAA-BasicSorts
- DSAA-MergeSort
- DSAA-QuickSort
- DSAA-Dynamic Programing
- DSAA-Exercises

Its generally finished but if there is any error or problems you see, feel free to message me. 

### Fog and Haze Remover
This was our final project. We aimed to test different type of Dehazing algorithms to have clear image in %80 fog. We test manual dehazing algorithms and ML based dehazing algoriithms. Than we created a platform to test the algorithms in real time. Its at the page and its called:
- FHR

### Human Resources Managment Project with JFOenix 
This was our project for sofware engineering lesson. We aplied MVC design pattern and test the knowladge about SRS implementation use cases ext. Also we deoplyed the back-end and front-end of the program. Name of the project is:
- HRMS
